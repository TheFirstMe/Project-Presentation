\frametitle{Conclusion and Future Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We presented a method to recognize handwritten texts using a 
    system based on LSTM-RNNs, model widely applied to transcribe 
    isolated text lines, and is inspired from the recent attention-based models.
    \item The answers recognized are fed to a NLP model along with a the answer key
    to evaluate the answer paper.
    \item In future, we plan to provide features for sending answer paper copies to student.
    \item We also plan to carry out revaluation requests.
