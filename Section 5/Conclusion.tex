\begin{itemize}
    \item We presented a method to recognize handwritten texts using a 
    system based on CNN-LSTM model widely applied to transcribe 
    isolated text lines.
    \item A GUI was provided for teachers and students.
    \item A CER of 8.57\% was obtained.
    \item The WER was relatively high as seen from results.
    \item Semantic analysis was done on a word-word comparison.
    \item This lead to false postives. Need to improve this in the future.
\end{itemize}
